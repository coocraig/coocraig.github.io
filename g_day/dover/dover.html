        <h1>Dover, New Hampshire</h1>
        <h5>November, 2021</h5>
        <p class = "body_text"><br>We departed via an uber playing dubstep music at a level condicive to minor hearing loss, and arrived to our small hamlet after a short trip, both of us taken aback by the skyscrapers, and vibrant night life of Dover, New Hampshire.
        <br><br>After going directly to bed the night prior, we took a jaunt to soak in all that Dover had to offer. We ventured first to a public library, ripe with that good old library smell, then to a fairly quaint local diner for breakfast. We continued to frolic down the streets once possibly walked by the founding fathers for the remainder of the day, relaxing and studying in the airbnb as the sun began to fall. <br> We then hit the bustling, lively streets to go to a decent, but ultimately overpriced resturant, and finished our night by watching The Big Short and an episode of squid games (just one because it is scary).<br><br> The next day was followed by more tranquility, we had a late start and mostly did homework, though prior to heading out for the night, we did go for a run. We met up with some of my family, who drove pretty agressivey to get to this fairly fancy place on the ocean. After some lobsta and other fish, we headed back to the place. The next morning, I walked you down to the train station, and thought of how lucky I was to be able to call you my person.</p>
