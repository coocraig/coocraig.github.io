        <h5>September 27, 2019</h5>
        <p class = "body_text"><br>We began the day by taking Loua for a walk, it was a perfect 70 degree day with a slight breeze. We then departed in my car shortly afterwards, venturing off along i 90.<br><br> 
            Once we reached Whitehall, we turned to a road skating alongside forboding peaks of the Tabacoo Root range. The fall colors (even though not as good as in New Hampshire), added a variety of striking yellow hues to the arid landscape, only superceded by the golden locks of my favorite passenger.
        <br>We pulled up to the nearly abandoned parking lot, paid our fee and ventured into the great, spooky unkown. I can't regale you with a whole bunch of specifics, but all in all, we saw some ghosts, and were in a town, so what more can you expect. What I can say is that I got to spend nearly a whole day with my favorite person in the world.
        <br>After the excitement from seeing the abandonded attic where they stuck dying children who had scarlet fever, we went to Dairy Queen to get some weirdly purple root beer floats.</p>
