	<h1>More Duets and More Dollars?<br> Can the difference between the two "We are the Worlds" be attributed to the difference in star-laden duets?</h1>
    <h3>A collection of visualizations exploring the differences between the original, extremely commercially succesful "We Are the World" by U.S.A For Africa and it's lesser successor, "We are the World 25 for Haiti".</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Released in 1985, the original "We are the World" was a hit single that brought together massive artists ranging from country to soul, all in the name of raising money torwards combating poverty in Africa. It featured all-time greats like Michael Jackson and Kenny Rogers singing on the same stage, resulting in, according to producer Lionel Richie, above $50 million dollars for charity, and one grammy for song of the year. A distinct feature of this piece is the use of shared vocal lines, or short duets, to fully showcase the diversity and starpower present out of the singers in attendence. These duets also had the ability of putting whoever was chosen in the spotlight, leading to the incentive to choose popular artists to fill these spots in order to maximize possible watchtime and attention gained. 25 years later following a devastating earthquake in Haiti, popular artists attempted to emulate the success of the prior track. Despite the good intentions, the track fell short and would end up behind its predecessor in nearly every measure, aside from its reliance on autotune, the use of which was a common critique of the piece.  </p>
    <p>Many critiqued the later for having too few big artists from too few genres, and for lacking the diversity and artists duetting that the prior was known for (in other words, less duets with less famous people). <b>This leads to the question, were there more duos in the first song? And were less popular musicians chosen to be in them in the 2010 version?</b></p>
