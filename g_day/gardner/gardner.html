        <h1>Somewhere near Gardner</h1>
        <h5>June, 2020</h5>
        <p class = "body_text">I have no idea why I didn't take any pictures of this, but it was honestly one of the better times I can remember while camping, and I hope my words can be enough to illustrate how special of a time it was for me 
            (and hopefuly you). <br><br>To be honest, I don't know how I ever convinced you to just go camping without a 10 mile long run up a 
            mountain to get to the spot, but I somehow did, and you chose the spot, a nice little, 
            remote area outside of Gardner, with a direct view of white sulphur springs.
            <br>The journey there was incredible to begin with, driving with you through some
             of the most gorgeous scenery in the world is a truly special thing.<br><br>We really
              didn't do anything special during this trip, we cooked some italian dishes (eye-talian), 
              romped around some grassy fields and zipped up the tent as the sun was going down.<br><br>There was nothing super noteworthy about this trip, we didn't see any bears, no moose, or really anything too noteworthy, but all in all it was noteworthy in how tranquil and absolutely at paece I felt throughout our time there. </p>
