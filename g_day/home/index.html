          <h1>Welcome to Day 1 of your Birthday Present</h1>
          <h6>(Don't worry, you will actually get a physical gift by the end of this)</h6>
          <div class = "info">
            <p>Georgi, I apologize for how poorly your room smells right now (because of the abscence of your yankee candle, which I, your boyfriend should have purchased you (haha very funny)). To try and attempt to gain your forgiveness, this year, you have 7 days of different gifts, both coming in real life, or delivered through this website. Some are sentimental, while others hopefully have a more useful purpose.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>All in all though, I am incredibly thankful for having you in my life, and I hope a quick read of any of these trip memories will shed an inkling of how much I love you and how much you have changed my life.</p>
