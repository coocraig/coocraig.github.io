                    <h2>Description:</h2>   
                    <p>New York City parents have the relatively unique distinction of being able to, in certain districts, choose from a plethora of public schools to send their child to (Or attempt to). Proponents of this policy claim that this will allow market forces to create a better system of schooling over time by forcing schools to compete with eachother. Opponents, on the other hand, claim that it will serve to only exacerbate already present educational attainment divides by allowing students to in essence, "run away" from their local failing school. Additionally, the application process tends to select for families of higher incomes.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: </h2><hr>
            <p>There visually appears to be some validity to the hypothesis that being closer to a better-performing school leads to higher test scores in the surrounding area, but this is a very, very inconclusive result. There is most likely many confounding variables that can't properly be taken account for in a visualization and would require other statistical methods.</p>
